What is data? It's purest from is raw data which is coming from APIs, files, videos, databases, livestreams, etc. 

Types of Data:
Structured data – stored in tables (rows and columns).which we can use to store in well organized Relational Database or linked data in MySQL or PostgreSQL databases
Unstructured data – text, images, videos, emails.
Semi-structured data – JSON, XML, logs.

Data Storage:
Relational databases
JSON files
Key-value storage
Distributed storage systems

ETL and ELT:
ETL (Extract → Transform → Load) - Data is transformed before loading into storage.
ELT (Extract → Load → Transform) - Data is loaded first, then transformed.
ELT is more cost-effective, especially in cloud environments, because cloud systems can handle transformation at scale.

Change Data Capture (CDC):
Captures only changes made in source systems.Avoids full data reload. Improves performance and efficiency.
A new new concept was introduced which is basically a classification of how and what types of data can we extract or say is ingested into our system. 
For example, time sensitive or live. 

So we were told the two main types of data capturing or processes: 1) Real-time data synchronization and 2) Batch processing. 

For understanding realtime data (live) we can consider the example of Uber/Ola cab services where in every second or minute of the live data coming from a rider or the driver is important to be present 
In Batch processing Data is collected over a period of time.Processed at fixed intervals (daily, weekly).Suitable for large volumes of data.

Data Pipelines: A data pipeline is a flow that moves data from source to destination. It Should be Modular,Reusable,Fault-tolerant and also includes ingestion, processing, and storage stages.

Data Warehouse: A Data Warehouse stores structured and processed data.Used for analytics and reporting. Separates analytical workload from transactional systems.

Data Warehouse Layers (Medallion Architecture)

Bronze – raw data

Silver – cleaned and transformed data

Gold – aggregated, analytics-ready data

Definition of Hadoop: Hadoop is a distributed framework used to store and process large volumes of data.Designed for big data and parallel processing.

Definition of Spark:Apache Spark is a fast, in-memory data processing engine.Designed to process large scale data efficiently.
